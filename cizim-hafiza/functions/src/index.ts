/**
 * Fires whenever a friend match invite is written to
 * users/{uid}/invites/{inviteId} (see FriendRepositoryImpl.sendMatchInvite
 * in the Android app) and pushes a notification to the recipient's device —
 * this is what lets an invite reach someone whose app isn't currently open
 * (FriendInviteMessagingService.kt only fires from a live app process; this
 * function is what wakes it up).
 *
 * The message payload is data-only (no top-level `notification` field) on
 * purpose: a `notification` payload gets displayed directly by the OS when
 * the app is backgrounded/killed, bypassing FriendInviteMessagingService
 * entirely — which means no custom channel, no localized text (this
 * function has no idea what language the recipient's device is in), and no
 * tap-through PendingIntent to open the app. A data-only payload always
 * hands control to onMessageReceived, which builds everything from the
 * recipient's own local string resources.
